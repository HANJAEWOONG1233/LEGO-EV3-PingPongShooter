## 🔧 How It Works

### 🎯 Shooting Algorithm
- The robot moves forward while using its arm to shoot a ping pong ball.
- After shooting, it reverses and switches to standby mode.
- Repositions itself for the next shot.

### 📡 Utilizing the Ultrasonic Sensor
- While reversing, the robot continuously measures the distance to the wall using the ultrasonic sensor.
- Designed to maintain an optimal distance of **5cm or more**.

### 🔄 Repetitive Actions
- Repeats shooting and standby actions throughout the match duration.

### 📝 Detailed Algorithm Flow
1. **Initialization**: Initialize motors and sensors, then enter ready state.
2. **Match Start**:
   - **Move Forward**: Move at a speed compliant with competition rules.
   - **Shoot Ball**: Activate the arm motor to launch the ball.
   - **Move Backward**: Reverse while checking distance with the ultrasonic sensor.
   - **Standby**: Prepare for the next shot upon meeting specified conditions.
3. **Match End**: Halt all actions after the set time elapses.
